        <h2>What Happened?</h2>
        <p>In 2018, it was revealed that <span class="highlight">Facebook</span> had improperly shared data from millions of users with the political consulting firm <strong>Cambridge Analytica</strong>. This data was used to create detailed psychological profiles to influence voter behavior.</p>
        
        <h2>How Was the Data Used?</h2>
        <p>Facebook allowed third-party apps to access user data â€” not just of the user, but also their friends, without clear consent. This data included likes, interests, and even private messages. Cambridge Analytica then used this data to target ads and misinformation during elections.</p>
        
        <h2>What Were the Consequences?</h2>
        <p>Facebook faced heavy criticism, legal fines, and a loss of public trust. Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress, promising better data protection. However, many argue that social media platforms still prioritize profit over privacy.</p>
